# train-scheduler
A train schedule application that incorporates Firebase to host arrival and departure data. My app retrieves and manipulate this information with Moment.js. This website will provide up-to-date information about various trains, namely their arrival times and how many minutes remain until they arrive at their station. The app gets updated every minute.
